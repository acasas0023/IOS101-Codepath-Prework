**APP IDEA:** An app that will track food vendors near you, focusing on ones that do not have a fixed location. This includes food/ice cream trucks and smaller vendors that travel through neighborhoods and parks. Other possible features include notifications when vendors are in your area, following certain vendors, and/or inclusion of menus/items. This app would enable workers to expand their business and allow users to find their favorite snacks that aren't sold in stores. 

## Notes

No unique/unexpected challenges. Focused on learning basic XCode/Swift functionality.
